# Stellar-Motion_Matlab
Analysis of Stellar Motion using Matlab Coding 
We can learn a lot about a star even though it is thousand light years away from us, by examining the light that is coming fro it. By using a diffraction gradient we can split the light into its individual wavelenth (just like water droplets putting sunlight into a rainbow) .Measuring the intensity of the light observed at each wavelength gives each stars charecteristics spectrums. 

In this project we will be examining about the motion of star HD94028 a faint star in the constellation of leo.By studying the plot of intensity vs wavelength we notice a deep spike at some point which indicate that not much light is radiated at that paticular wavelength from the star.

This is the common feature of many star because hydrogen, a major component of most stars absorbs light at precisely 656.3 nanometers. The deep spike in the graph of HD94028 called the Alpha line occurs slightly at a longer wavelenth than 656.3 nanometers. This is because the star is moving away from the earth 

A star spectrum is blue shifted(i.e. shifted to shorter wavelenth when star moves towards the Earth) and red shifted (i.e. shifted to longer wavelengths if it is moving away )

We have used Matlab programming to find the observed walength of the hydrogen alpha line of HD94028 and compare it to the known wavelength of the hydogen absorptionto determine how fast the star is moving  away from the earth.
