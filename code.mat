%The spectra data was collected at evenly-spaced wavelengths, and  the starting wavelength (λstart), the spacing (λdelta), and the number of observations.

load starData
nObs = size(spectra,1)
lambdaStart = 630.02
lambdaDelta = 0.14

%Creating a variable named lambdaEnd (λend) that contains the value of the last wavelength in the recorded spectrum. We can calculate lambdaEnd with the equation λstart+(nObs−1)λdelta.

lambdaEnd = lambdaStart + (nObs-1)*lambdaDelta   % Using lambdaEnd to make a vector named lambda (λ) containing the wavelengths in the spectrum, from λstart to λend, in steps of λdelta.
lambda = (lambdaStart:lambdaDelta:lambdaEnd)'

%Each column of spectra is containing spectrum of a different star. The sixth column is the spectrum of star HD 94028 .
%Now Extracting the sixth column of spectra to a vector named s.

s = spectra(:,6)

%Now Using  the loglog function in the same way as the plot function to plot data using a log scales for each axis. loglog(x,y,"*--")

loglog(lambda,s,".-")

%Now the  min function allows two outputs, the second of which is the index at which the minimum value occurred. This index corresponds to the location of the Hydrogen-alpha line.
%Creating  two variables, sHa and idx that contain the minimum value of s and the index where the minimum value occurred.
% using idx to index into lambda to find the wavelength of the Hydrogen-alpha line and  Storing the result as lambdaHa (λHa).

[sHa,idx] = min(s)
lambdaHa = lambda(idx)

%The line (lambdaHa,sHa) is the location of the Hydrogen-alpha line.

%Using the Hydrogen-alpha wavelength of the star, you can calculate the redshift factor (the speed of the star relative to the earth) using the formula z=(λHa/656.28)−1. You can then calculate the speed by multiplying the redshift factor by the speed of light (299792.458km/s).
%Calculating the redshift factor and the speed (in km/s) at which the star is moving away from the earth. Assigning the redshift factor to a variable called z and the speed to a variable called speed.

z = lambdaHa/656.28 - 1
speed = z*299792.458
